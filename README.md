# FitnessBro website
WIP

Directory structure:
- assets - where we put .css stuff and images
- config - where we put variables like db usernames and passwords
- lib - if we need libraries - i think we're using bootstrap for frontend so put that there
- public - where index.php is - basiclally the landing page that rerouts all traffic to the correct functions and stuff
- src - source code, its split into Models (backend logic), Views (frontend html and display), Controllers (links frontend and backend)
- tests - put unit tests here

Update changelog as we continue

We might need a docs/ folder for documentation in the future

Also note that there is no official php project structure, I just made this based on what I think we need
Feel free to change files around
