/*
WIP
This should be the first & default php file that runs when a user first enters ourwebsite.com or whatever
I don't think the important .php files should be directly accessed 
Instead, all requests and stuff should go thru this file and be routed to their respective .php in src folder
There should be logic here that redirects to the different pages of the website
